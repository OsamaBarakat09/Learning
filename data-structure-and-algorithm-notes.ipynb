    "- large memory capacities have created a spiral of complexity.\n",
    "- Computer science is concerned by problem solving.\n",
    "- a computer scientist’s goal is to develop an algorithm.\n",
    "- computer science is the study of abstractions,Abstraction allows us to view the problem and solution in such a way as to separate the so-called logical and physical perspectives.\n",
    "- any sequence or order to doing thing you see it is called algorithm or logical perspective of this sequence.\n",
    "- The function that you put some info in it and you use it in another place is called **interface**.\n",
    "- The steps taht we prepare it to solve problem is called **logical perspective** and the way that this steps is implementation by it is called **Physical perspective**.\n",
    "** if we say the sequence of number 5,9,6,8 and 3 the order is calles **Logical prespective**.\n",
    "** But if we say that the way of implementaion this sequence is by multiply this sequence this operation is called **Physical prespective**. \n",
    "- **procedural abstraction**: We do not necessarily know how the square root is being calculated, but we know what the function is called and how to use it.\n",
    "** math.sqrt(): Sqrt() is calles here a **Black box**.\n",
    "- Computer science is not the study of programming. Programming, however, is an important part of what a computer scientist does. Programming is often the way that we create a representation for our solutions.\n",
    "- All data items in the computer are represented as strings of binary digits. In order to give these strings meaning, we need to have **data types**.Data types provide an interpretation for this binary data so that we can think about the data in terms that make sense with respect to the problem being solved. These low-level, built-in data types (sometimes called the primitive data types) provide the building blocks for algorithm development.\n",
    "- Why studying data structure and abstract data type?\n",
    "-- To manage the complexity of problems and the problem-solving process\n",
    "- computer scientists use abstractions to allow them to focus on the “big picture” without getting lost in the details. By creating models of the problem domain, we are able to utilize a better and more efficient problem-solving process. These models allow us to describe the data that our algorithms will manipulate in a much more consistent way with respect to the problem itself.\n",
    "- **ADT**: Abstract data type: is a logical description of how we view the data and the operations that are allowed without regard to how they will be implemented.\n",
    "- We are concerned only with what the data is representing and not with how it will eventually be constructed.By providing this level of abstraction, we are creating an **encapsulation** around the data. The idea is that by encapsulating the details of the implementation, we are hiding them from the user’s view. This is called **information hiding**.\n",
    "- The user interacts with the interface, using the operations that have been specified by the abstract data type. The abstract data type is the shell that the user interacts with. The implementation is hidden one level deeper. The user is not concerned with the details of the implementation.\n",
    "- Implementation of an abstract data type == Data structure.\n",
    "- **Primative data types**:\n",
    "** integer(int)\n",
    "** Floating(float)\n",
    "** String(str)\n",
    "** Boolean(bool)\n",
    "- Independent Implementation means an implementation of a Specification that does not, except for code validly licensed for such purpose, incorporate or otherwise make any use of the corresponding RI."
